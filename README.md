# RickAndMortyAPIDemoApp
This project produces two identical iOS apps â€“ one using UIKit and one using SwiftUI. It pulls data from the popular Rick and Morty API at [https://rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

## Requirements
Xcode 14 and iOS 16 (both currently in BETA)

## API
The [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) is geared towards web apps. The API pages its data, returning a max of 20 results at a time. Therefore the app makes multiple calls to the API to download the full data so the user can navigate without paging.

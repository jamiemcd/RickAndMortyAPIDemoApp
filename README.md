# RickAndMortyAPIDemoApp
This project produces two ~~identical~~ nearly identical iOS apps â€“ one using UIKit and one using SwiftUI. It pulls data from the popular Rick and Morty API at [https://rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

## Requirements
Xcode 14 and iOS 16 (both currently in BETA)

## Rick (UIKit)
The Rick version of the app is coded using modern UIKit and requires iOS 15.
Modern UIKit basically means the following: 

- `UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration` instead of `UITableView`
- `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource` instead of classic `UICollectionViewDataSource` 
- `UICollectionView.dequeueConfiguredReusableCell(using:for:item:)` instead of classic `UICollectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier:for:)`
- `UICollectionViewListCell`, `UIContentView`, and `UIContentConfiguration` instead of subclassing `UICollectionViewCell`

Understanding these took some time, since I have been accustomed to classic UIKit since back in the Objective-C days (but not as far back as pre-ARC ðŸ¦•). `UITableView` is a proud workhorse of iOS apps everywhere! After I watched the below WWDC videos multiple times, I found using `UICollectionView` and the modern apis to be some great evolution for UIKit.

## Morty (SwiftUI)
The Morty version of the app is coded using SwiftUI and requires iOS 16. It  uses `NavigationStack` along with `navigationDestination(for:destination:)`.

## Shared Code
Both apps share the model layer and the cloud layer.

Additionaly, instead of classic `completionHandler`s, the cloud code uses modern `async/await`. (Which is great and I hope to avoid the Combine framework entirely except for using `ObservableObject`.)

## API
The [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) is geared towards web apps. The API pages its data, returning a max of 20 results at a time. Therefore the app makes multiple calls to the API to download the full data so the user can navigate and search without paging.

## Using the App
There are a total of 6 screens in the app.

- A searchable list of all characters
- A searchable list of all locations
- A searchable list of all episodes
- A character detail screen
- A location detail screen
- An episode detail screen

When you select a character, location, or episode from one of the lists the detail screen is shown in a modal. 

From the Character Detail screen you can navigate to a character's origin, last known location, or any episode the character appeared in.

From the Location Detail screen you can navigate to any character associated with that location.

From the Episode Detail screen you can navigate to any character appearing in the episode.

You can push an unlimited number of characters, locations, and episodes on the detail screen before dismissing it.
